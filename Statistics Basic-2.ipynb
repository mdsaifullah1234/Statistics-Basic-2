    "In statistics, skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean. Skewness is often used to characterize the shape of a distribution and to determine whether it is symmetrical or asymmetrical. A distribution is said to be symmetrical if it is mirror-imaged across its mean. A distribution is said to be asymmetrical if it is not mirror-imaged across its mean. There are two types of skewness: positive skewness and negative skewness.\n",

    "Positive skewness occurs when the tail of the distribution extends to the right, meaning that there are more data points on the right side of the mean than there are on the left side of the mean. A positively skewed distribution is sometimes referred to as a \"right-skewed\" distribution.\n",
